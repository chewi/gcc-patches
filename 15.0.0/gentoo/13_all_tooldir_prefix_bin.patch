Subject: [PATCH 2/3] Do not search for tools relative to the driver when
 cross-compiling

On Gentoo, this location is /usr/${CHOST}/bin. Native toolchains put
symlinks to the binutils tools here. Cross toolchains only put
non-native binaries here. The binutils symlinks live under
/usr/libexec/gcc/${CHOST} instead, and that location is already
searched.

It would be better to fail to find a given tool than inadvertently try
to execute a non-native build of it via QEMU.
